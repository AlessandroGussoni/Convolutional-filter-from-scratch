# Convolutional-filter-from-scratch

This repository contains two function used to create from scratch convolutional filters starting from an image. The idea is to help people who have just started to approach deep computer vision to better understand the basic unit of convolutional layer. Please cite this profile and Alessandro Gussoni for any usage of the code
